# Safety & Privacy

`cct` is designed to be **safe by default** and to never silently destroy
your local **Codex** or **Claude Code** sessions. This document explains the
safety model in detail and, just as importantly, the **privacy risks of
`.codexbundle` files**.

> Both agents are covered. cct reads/writes Codex rollout files
> (`~/.codex/sessions/…`) and Claude Code transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/…`) and
> applies the same guarantees to each. Where a section says "Codex", the same
> applies to Claude Code unless noted. (`.codexbundle` is the historical bundle
> extension, kept for compatibility; a bundle records which agent it came from.)

Read the privacy section before you share a bundle with anyone.

## 1. `.codexbundle` files may contain sensitive data

A `.codexbundle` is a packaged copy of your real session files — Codex **rollout
files** or Claude Code **transcripts**. Those files are a full transcript of a
session, so a bundle can contain:

- **Your prompts** — everything you typed to the agent.
- **Model output** — including code, explanations, and suggested commands.
- **Source code** — snippets and files that were read into or written during the session.
- **Terminal output** — command results the agent captured.
- **Absolute filesystem paths** — revealing your username, directory layout, and project names.
- **Git metadata** — branch names, commit SHAs, and remote URLs.
- **Secrets that were accidentally printed** — API keys, tokens, passwords, or
  `.env` contents that happened to appear in a prompt, a file, or command output
  during the session. The agent records what it sees; it does not scrub secrets.
- **Uploaded images and attachments** — anything you dropped into a session.

> **Treat a `.codexbundle` like you would treat your shell history plus your
> source tree.** It is at least as sensitive as both.

### A note on images and attachments

When you drop an image (or other attachment) into a Codex session, it is stored
**inline in the rollout JSONL as base64**, not as a separate file reference.
That has two consequences for bundles:

- **They travel with the bundle by default.** Because the image bytes live inside
  the rollout file, exporting a session also exports every image in it — unless you
  pass `--strip-images` (below).
- **They inflate bundle size.** Base64 encoding is ~33% larger than the raw
  image, so image-heavy sessions produce noticeably larger `.codexbundle` files.

**Omitting images: `export --strip-images`.** This replaces each inline image with
a short placeholder, keeping the conversation text. It is **lossy** (the picture
bytes are dropped) and opt-in. Besides shrinking the bundle, it is a quick way to
avoid carrying screenshots you would rather not move — though it is a size/privacy
convenience, not a redaction guarantee: review a bundle's contents if it must be
free of sensitive material.

> **Not for incremental sync.** Stripping changes a session's bytes, so a stripped
> bundle no longer lines up with an unstripped copy of the same session: `import
> --merge` will treat it as *diverged* rather than appending the new messages. Use
> `--strip-images` for a one-off, space-saving import — not to keep a session in
> sync across machines where the other copy still has its images.

### Practical guidance

- **Do not post bundles publicly** — not in GitHub issues, gists, pastebins, or chat.
- **Do not commit a bundle to a repository by default.** Add `*.codexbundle` to
  your `.gitignore` unless you have deliberately chosen otherwise (see
  "Committing a bundle on purpose" below).
- Move bundles over channels you trust (USB stick, `scp`/`rsync` over SSH,
  Syncthing, an encrypted drive).
- **Encrypt the bundle** if it must travel over a channel you do not fully
  control: `cct export … --encrypt-to <age-recipient>` (or
  `--passphrase`) produces a `.codexbundle.age` that only the holder of the key
  or passphrase can read (see §11).
- If you must share a bundle for debugging, **inspect it first**
  (`cct inspect bundle.codexbundle`) and assume the JSONL inside contains
  everything from those sessions.
- Delete bundles you no longer need.

`cct` does **not** upload anything anywhere. The only data movement is you
copying the file by hand. The privacy risk is entirely about **who you hand the
file to**.

### Committing a bundle on purpose

The `cct-session-sync` skill (`cct skill install`) does the one thing the bullet
above warns about: it keeps a bundle in git. There are two layouts, and the
first exists precisely to limit the exposure:

- **A separate private session store.** One private repo holds the bundles for
  all your projects; each project repo commits only `.cct/sessions.json`, a
  reference naming that store. The code repo — which may be public, or shared
  with people who should not read your transcripts — gains no history at all.
  The reference records the store URL, the project's folder, the encryption
  mode, and at most an age *recipient* (a public key). No local paths, no
  private key: `cct skill init` writes it, `cct skill show` explains it.
- **In the project's own repo**, under `.cct/`. Simplest, and only acceptable
  when that repo is itself private.

Either way it is a real trade — make it knowingly:

- Everyone with repo access can read every prompt, code excerpt, and command
  output in those sessions, and git history keeps them after a later deletion.
- The skill therefore requires an explicit answer up front, stored as
  `cct config set repo-sync plain|encrypted`. In `plain` mode it must confirm
  with you that the remote is private before the first commit; in `encrypted`
  mode the committed file is `age`-encrypted (§11) and the plaintext bundle is
  removed, so a mistakenly public repo leaks nothing.
- The export secret gate (§1) applies unchanged. The skill is instructed never
  to pass `--allow-secrets` itself and never to `git push` without asking you.
- The skill file is instructions for an agent, not a sandbox. It constrains a
  cooperating agent; it cannot stop one from running other commands. Nothing in
  it grants any capability that `cct` did not already have.

**A reference file is untrusted input.** `.cct/sessions.json` lives in a
repository, so anyone who can commit — or get a pull request merged — can change
which store it names, and an agent that clones and imports from it would be
fetching an attacker's bundle. cct treats it accordingly:

- `ReadReference` validates before anything acts on it. Remote-helper transports
  (`ext::`, `fd::` — the command-execution vector, see §10) and flag-like values
  are refused with the same rule `import --clone` uses; so are control
  characters, a project name that is not a plain slug, a path that disagrees
  with that name, an unknown schema version, and an age *private* key.
- `cct skill show` prints the URL with an explicit reminder that it came from
  the repository rather than from you, and scrubs every value it prints (§10).
- The skill instructs the agent to show you the URL and ask before cloning or
  importing from a store it did not set up, and never to treat prose inside
  those files as your instructions.
- cct itself never clones the store: that stays a `git clone` you run.

`cct skill install` writes exactly one file, `SKILL.md`, inside your Claude Code
home's `skills/` directory. It reads no sessions, writes no session file, and
touches neither `~/.claude.json` nor Codex's SQLite index (§5). An existing file
with different contents is never replaced without `--force`, which keeps a
backup.

---

## 2. Import never overwrites your sessions silently

Import is deliberately conservative. For each session in the bundle, exactly one
of these happens:

| Situation | What `cct` does |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| The session does **not** exist locally | **Imported** (new file written). |
| The session exists locally and is **identical to the effective import content** | **Skipped** (already present). |
| The session exists locally but **differs** | **Reported as a conflict and skipped** by default — your local file is left untouched. With `--merge`, a session that merely *grew* on the other device is extended in place (append-only, lossless). With `--replace-with-backup`, the local file is first backed up and then overwritten; with `--import-as-copy`, the bundle's version is imported as a brand-new session and your local file is left untouched (see below). |

For normal imports, the effective import content is the byte-for-byte bundle
entry. For `--map-cwd` imports, the effective content is the safely rewritten
plain `.jsonl` file.

By default there is no force overwrite: a differing file is **never** replaced,
and if you see conflicts reported, your existing sessions were not modified.

### Relocating a project

`cct relocate OLD NEW` is a local wrapper around the same export, cwd-mapping,
and import engine. It first creates a bundle inside a private temporary
directory, validates the complete mapped import in dry-run mode, and verifies
that the source rollouts did not change while the plan was prepared. The real
import opts into `--replace-with-backup`, so every rewritten rollout keeps its
original bytes and participates in the standard undo journal. CCT validates the
real import result against the same completeness invariant before reporting
success; an incomplete result triggers session rollback.

Archived Codex sessions use the same safety path only when `--include-archived`
is explicit. If a compressed rollout's cwd cannot be recovered, relocation
refuses to proceed because it cannot prove that every matching session will be
updated.

With `--move-project`, CCT renames the project directory only after the session
preflight succeeds. It supports same-filesystem renames and rolls the directory
back if import fails or produces an incomplete result; it never falls back to
copy-and-delete. Stop the agent before relocating so it cannot append to a
session between validation and replacement.

**Claude Code (`--tool claude`).** Claude records the project in two places: the
per-line `cwd` inside a transcript and the `projects/<encoded-cwd>/` folder
holding it. Relocating therefore also moves each transcript to the folder that
encodes the new path, which the import path alone would not finish — it would
write the remapped copy and leave the original behind under the same session id.
So relocation writes every remapped transcript first, and only then backs up and
deletes each original, re-verifying immediately before each delete that the file
is still an ordinary file with exactly the bytes that were exported. If any
destination is already taken (whether its content differs or matches), relocation
stops before writing anything rather than duplicating a session id. A failure
after the copies are written restores the removed originals from their backups,
deletes the copies, and rolls back a `--move-project` rename. `~/.claude.json` is
never read or written; Claude Code rediscovers the transcripts on its next run.

**A project's auto memory moves too.** Claude Code keeps it in
`projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/`, under the same encoded key as the transcripts,
so relocating only the transcripts would leave the project with its
conversations and without what the agent had learned about it. Memory files
follow the transcript discipline: every file is copied and its bytes verified
first, each original is removed only afterwards (backed up, re-verified
immediately before the delete, and confined to the projects directory), and both
halves enter the undo journal. Memory is **never** overwritten — a destination
file of the same name with different content stops the whole relocation before
anything is written. A byte-identical file is left alone and its original is
still moved out, so the old folder does not keep a stale second copy.

`cct undo` reverses both halves of a Claude relocation. It restores each original
before removing its relocated copy, and if an original cannot be restored — a
missing or tampered backup, or something occupying its path again — the copy is
kept, so a session is never left with no copy at all. The same pairing applies to
memory files.

`--include-archived` is refused with `--tool claude`: Claude Code keeps no
separate archive location, so every transcript recorded under `OLD` is already
part of the relocation.

### Incremental sync (`--merge`): append-only, lossless

Session files (Codex rollouts and Claude transcripts) are **append-only logs** —
new turns are added to the end; existing lines are never edited. So when you keep
working on the same conversation on the source device and re-export, the bundle's
copy is the local copy **plus extra trailing lines**.

`--merge` uses this. For each conflicting session it compares the bundle's content
with your local file as a byte prefix:

- **Local file is a prefix of the bundle's version** → the session just grew. `cct`
  writes the longer bundle version (atomic temp-file + rename), which **appends the
  new lines and discards nothing** — your local content is, by definition, fully
  contained in what is written. No backup is needed because nothing is lost. This
  is reported as "Updated (new messages appended): N (+M lines)".
- **Bundle is a prefix of your local file** → your machine is *ahead*; the local
  file already contains everything in the bundle. It is left untouched ("already up
  to date").
- **Neither is a prefix of the other** → the session genuinely diverged on both
  sides. `--merge` does **not** try to combine them; it leaves the entry a conflict
  for `--replace-with-backup` / `--import-as-copy` or the default skip.

`--merge` only ever extends an append-only log; it never reorders, edits, or merges
conflicting content. It is idempotent (re-importing the same bundle is a no-op),
writes nothing under `--dry-run`, and composes with the two flags below (it
resolves clean growth first and hands true divergence to them). Compressed
`.jsonl.zst` sessions are compared on their decompressed contents only when the
`zstd` tool is installed; otherwise a differing compressed session stays a conflict.

### Opting in to replacing a conflict (`--replace-with-backup`)

A conflict means the same session exists on both machines but has diverged — for
example you continued the chat locally after a previous import. If you want the
bundle's version to win, pass `--replace-with-backup`. For each conflicting file
`cct` then:

1. copies the existing local file to a sibling backup named
   `…jsonl.cct-bak-<timestamp>`. That suffix does **not** match Codex's
   `rollout-*.jsonl` pattern, so Codex ignores the backup on its next scan;
2. overwrites the local file with the bundle's version using the same atomic
   write (temp file + rename) as a normal import.

The previous content is therefore always recoverable from the backup. The flag
is opt-in, is reported as "Replaced (backup kept): N", and writes nothing under
`--dry-run`. Without the flag, the default never-overwrite behavior is unchanged.

### Importing a conflict as a new session (`--import-as-copy`)

If you would rather **keep both** versions of a diverged session, pass
`--import-as-copy` instead. For each conflicting plain `.jsonl` session,
`cct`:

1. assigns the bundle's version a **fresh session id** (a new random UUID),
   rewriting only the canonical `id` field of the `session_meta` line — every
   other line is preserved byte-for-byte and the result is validated before it is
   written (the same narrow-mutation discipline as `--map-cwd`, see §8);
2. writes it under a **new rollout filename** derived from that id, so it never
   collides with the existing local file.

Your diverged local session is left completely untouched; the bundle's version
appears alongside it in Codex as a separate conversation. It is reported as
"Imported as new copies: N", writes nothing under `--dry-run`, and is **mutually
exclusive** with `--replace-with-backup` (they resolve a conflict in opposite
ways). A compressed (`.jsonl.zst`) conflict, or a session without a
`session_meta` id, cannot be safely re-identified and so stays a skipped
conflict.

---

## 3. Checksums are verified before anything is written

Every bundle carries a `checksums.json` mapping each file to its SHA-256.

- On **import**, `cct` verifies the checksum of every file in the bundle
  **before it writes a single byte** to your Codex home.
- If any checksum does not match — a corrupt download, a truncated copy, or a
  tampered bundle — the import **aborts with nothing changed**.
- If `--map-cwd` is used, the original bundle checksum is still verified first.
  Then the mapped file intentionally differs from the bundle entry, so
  `cct` computes a new effective checksum for conflict detection.

This is a whole-bundle gate: either the bundle is intact and import proceeds, or
it is rejected and your Codex home is left exactly as it was.

---

## 4. Path-traversal and unexpected entries are rejected

Bundles are ZIP files, and ZIP files can be malicious. `cct` defends
against this:

- **Zip-slip / path traversal** (`..` segments) is rejected.
- **Absolute paths** and Windows drive-letter paths are rejected.
- **Backslashes** and non-canonical paths are rejected.
- Only entries matching `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl[.zst]` are eligible
  for import. Anything else is **skipped**, never written.

A crafted bundle cannot make `cct` write outside
`~/.codex/sessions/`.

---

## 5. SQLite is never modified

Codex keeps an internal SQLite database as an **index/cache**. The durable,
canonical record of every session is the JSONL rollout file on disk.

`cct` works **only** with those rollout files. It **never** opens, writes,
or migrates Codex's SQLite database. After you import, Codex rebuilds its own
index from the JSONL files on its next normal scan.

This is why the recommended step after import is simply: **restart the Codex App
(or run Codex again)** so it scans and reconciles the new files itself.

### Claude Code: the same guarantee, a different index

When you use `--tool claude`, the durable record is Claude Code's per-project
transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`) and the
rebuildable-index file is `~/.claude.json`. `cct` works **only** with the
transcripts and **never** opens, writes, or migrates `~/.claude.json`, and it
never touches the Claude cloud or your account. Claude Code rediscovers a
dropped-in transcript on its next run (verified empirically — no registry entry
is needed). The two agent-specific differences in how content can be rewritten:

- **`--map-cwd`** must also move the transcript into the folder for the new path
  (the project is addressed by the encoded folder name) **and** rewrite the
  recorded `cwd` on every line, since Claude repeats it per line. The rewrite is
  validated: the line count is unchanged, every line stays valid JSON, and nothing
  but `cwd` changes.
- **`--import-as-copy`** assigns a fresh `sessionId` (rewritten on every line) and
  a new `<uuid>.jsonl` filename, leaving your diverged local transcript untouched.

Everything else — checksums-before-write, no silent overwrites, path-traversal
rejection, atomic writes — is identical to the Codex path.

---

## 6. Atomic writes

Each imported file is written to a temporary file in the destination directory
and then renamed into place. A file is therefore **never left half-written**,
even if the process is interrupted mid-import.

---

## 7. cwd mismatch can affect where sessions appear

Codex's per-project sidebar filters sessions by the **working directory recorded
in the session** at the time it was created.

If your project lives at a different path on the two machines — for example
`/home/you/dev/app` on one and `C:\Users\you\projects\app` on the other — an
imported session is stored correctly and is fully intact, but Codex may **not
show it under that project's view**, because the recorded cwd no longer matches.

`cct` helps you find and fix this:

- **Discovery (read-only).** `inspect` lists the distinct project folders (cwds)
  recorded in a bundle and flags any that do not exist on the current machine;
  `import` shows the same summary when one or more are missing (including under
  `--dry-run`). This only reads the filesystem (`os.Stat`) and creates nothing.
  When something is missing, the output prints a ready-to-paste `--map-cwd` hint.
- Without `--map-cwd`, import detects the mismatch and warns, but imports
  byte-for-byte.
- With `--map-cwd OLD=NEW`, it can rewrite the recorded cwd for matching plain
  `.jsonl` sessions during import so they point at the destination machine's
  project path. (You can also simply create an empty folder at the recorded cwd
  and restart Codex.)

Example:

```bash
cct import ./project.codexbundle \
  --map-cwd "/home/you/dev/app=C:\\Users\\you\\projects\\app" \
  --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` first. Path mapping is useful, but it is the only feature in
`cct` that intentionally mutates session content.

---

## 8. `--map-cwd` is intentionally narrow

`--map-cwd` exists only to change Codex's project association metadata. It does
**not** do global search-and-replace.

When a mapping matches a plain `.jsonl` session:

- Only the canonical `cwd` field inside the `session_meta` line is rewritten.
- All non-`session_meta` lines are preserved byte-for-byte.
- Unknown fields inside `session_meta` are preserved semantically, although the
  `session_meta` line itself is re-serialized as JSON.
- The resulting JSONL is minimally validated before it is written.
- Existing files are still never overwritten silently.

`--map-cwd` deliberately does **not** rewrite:

- prompts
- assistant messages
- tool output
- terminal output
- file paths mentioned in normal chat content

When a mapping matches a compressed `.jsonl.zst` session and the external `zstd`
tool is installed, cct decompresses it, rewrites the `cwd` exactly as
above (only the `session_meta` line, validated), and recompresses it —
additionally verifying that the recompressed frame decompresses back to the
rewritten content before anything is written. Without `zstd`, a compressed
session that matches a mapping is copied byte-for-byte and reported as not
remapped.

### Cross-agent handoff (`--to`) is a translation, and only writes to the target

`import --to codex|claude` is a different operation from a normal import: it reads
the bundle (in whatever agent's format it was exported) and **translates** each
session into the *other* agent's format, writing the result into that agent's
home. Its safety properties:

- **Honest by construction.** The translated session carries the user/assistant
  conversation plus project context (cwd, git), with tool calls and command output
  **summarized to short text** — never replayed as real tool calls (the agents'
  tools and ids differ). It opens with a plain-language preamble that says it was
  handed off and is best-effort. No model/runtime state, permissions, or tokens
  cross over.
- **Source is read-only; only the target home is written.** The bundle's checksums
  are verified before anything is read, exactly like a native import. Nothing in
  the source agent's home is touched.
- **Deterministic and non-overwriting.** The synthesized session's id and
  timestamps are derived from the source, so re-running produces byte-identical
  output and an existing translated session is skipped, never overwritten or
  duplicated. Writes are atomic.
- **No cloud, as always.** Translation is entirely local; nothing is uploaded.

---

## 9. Compressed sessions: read-only metadata recovery, copied byte-for-byte

Compressed rollout files (`.jsonl.zst`) are always copied into a bundle
**byte-for-byte** and verified by checksum like any other file. `cct`
never recompresses, rewrites, or otherwise modifies them.

To make them more useful, `export` and `list` can **read** (decompress) the head
of a compressed rollout to recover its metadata — the recorded cwd, thread id,
and preview. This is done by shelling out to the external
[`zstd`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) tool, in the same single-binary,
dependency-free spirit as the git and `age` integrations. It is:

- **Read-only.** The compressed file is only decompressed into memory to read its
  first lines; the file on disk is never changed, and the byte-for-byte copy into
  a bundle is unaffected.
- **Best-effort and graceful.** If `zstd` is not installed, or a file is not
  valid zstd, the compressed session is simply reported as metadata-unknown,
  exactly as before — nothing fails.

With recovered metadata, a compressed session whose cwd matches `--project` is
now included in the export (previously it was always skipped because its cwd was
unknown), and `list`/`inspect` show its details and project folder. When `zstd`
is available, `--map-cwd` can also rewrite a compressed session's cwd on import
by decompressing, rewriting, and recompressing it (round-trip verified); see §8.

---

## 10. Git-assisted handoff is opt-in and only touches your own remote

`--with-git`/`--git-push` (export) and `--clone` (import) help move the **project
code** that a session refers to, without weakening the safety model. They act on
**git** — your code and your own git remote — and **never** on your sessions:
cct still never uploads a session or `.codexbundle` anywhere.

- **On export**, `--with-git` only **reads** git. It records the project's
  remote URL, branch, commit SHA, and whether the tree was dirty/unpushed into
  `manifest.json`. It never commits, pushes, or creates anything. The recorded
  remote URL and branch names become part of the bundle, so treat them as you
  would the rest of its contents (see §1).
- **On export, `--git-push`** is opt-in and the only thing that pushes. It runs a
  plain `git push <remote> <branch>` of your project's current branch to its
  **own** git remote, so the commit recorded in the bundle is actually fetchable
  on the other machine. It is deliberately conservative: it **never force-pushes**,
  never pushes tags, and never creates a remote (a diverged remote is rejected as
  a non-fast-forward, not overwritten). It uploads **your code to your remote**,
  never your sessions, and never to any cct service. If it fails, the
  export stops rather than produce a bundle that falsely claims the commit is
  fetchable.
- **On import**, with no `--clone` flag, cct only **prints** the
  `git clone … && git checkout <commit>` commands. Nothing runs.
- **`import --clone <dir>`** runs `git clone <recorded-remote> <dir>` and then
  `git checkout <recorded-commit>`. It is explicit, it only **fetches** (never
  pushes), it is skipped under `--dry-run`, and it writes only inside the `<dir>`
  you name — never into your Codex home.

So the only two outbound git actions are both opt-in: `--git-push` (push your code
to your remote) and `--clone` (fetch your code from your remote). If a bundle came
from an untrusted source, review the recorded remote URL with `cct inspect`
before using `--clone`, since cloning executes git against whatever URL the
manifest contains.

---

## 11. Encryption is optional, opt-in, and external

A `.codexbundle` is plaintext by default (see §1). When you must move one over a
channel you do not fully control, cct can encrypt it for you. Like the git
integration, it does **not** embed a crypto library: it shells out to the
well-known [`age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) tool, keeping cct a
single, dependency-free binary.

- **On export**, `--encrypt-to <recipient>` (repeatable), `--recipients-file`,
  or `--passphrase` write the bundle to `<output>.age`. The intermediate
  plaintext bundle is **removed** afterward, so a clear copy is not left behind.
- **On import/inspect**, a `.age` input is auto-detected and decrypted to a
  **temporary file** (requiring `--identity <file>` or `--passphrase`). That
  temporary plaintext is deleted when the command finishes.
- `--passphrase` is mutually exclusive with `--encrypt-to`/`--recipients-file`
  (age cannot mix the two).
- If `age` is not installed, encryption/decryption **fails with install
  guidance** and changes nothing else.

Encryption only protects the bundle **in transit and at rest**. Once decrypted
for import, the sessions are written to your Codex home in the clear, exactly as
an unencrypted bundle would be. It does not scrub secrets from the transcript
(see §1); it only controls **who can open the file**. And it does not change the
"never uploads" guarantee — encrypting still happens entirely on your machine.

---

## 12. Dry run

Use `cct import bundle.codexbundle --dry-run` to validate a bundle and see
exactly what *would* happen — new vs. already-present vs. conflict, and how many
sessions would be cwd-mapped — **without writing anything**. This is the safe way
to preview an import.

---

## 13. What cct deliberately does NOT do

These are intentional non-goals. They keep the tool small, predictable, and safe:

- **Does not modify Codex's SQLite database.** Ever. It only works with rollout
  files. Opt-in `import --reconcile` does not open SQLite or
  `session_index.jsonl`; it launches Codex's native app-server and asks Codex to
  read/verify exact thread IDs. The Codex process may update its own rebuildable
  index. If capability probing or verification fails, cct leaves the successful
  rollout import alone and prints restart/resume fallback guidance.
- **Does not rewrite session content by default.** Normal import is byte-for-byte.
  The only content mutations are opt-in and narrow: `--map-cwd` (the `cwd` field)
  and `--import-as-copy` (the `id` field), each touching a single `session_meta`
  field and validating the result before writing.
- **Does not globally rewrite paths.** `--map-cwd` only changes the canonical
  `cwd` field inside `session_meta` for matching plain `.jsonl` files.
- **Does not overwrite or merge existing sessions by default.** Conflicts are
  reported and skipped. The opt-in ways to act on a conflict are
  `--merge` (append-only sync: extend a session that grew on another device, when
  the local file is a byte-prefix of the bundle's — lossless, nothing dropped),
  `--replace-with-backup` (overwrite, keeping a recoverable backup of the local
  file first), and `--import-as-copy` (import the bundle's version as a brand-new
  session, leaving the local file untouched); see §2. Even `--merge` never
  *combines* edits — it only ever appends to an append-only log; a session that
  changed on both sides stays a conflict.
- **Does not rewrite `.jsonl.zst` files except under opt-in `--map-cwd`.** They
  are copied byte-for-byte by default; their contents may be decompressed
  read-only to recover metadata when `zstd` is available (see §9). The single
  exception is `--map-cwd`, which (with `zstd`) decompresses, rewrites only the
  `cwd` field, and recompresses — verifying the round-trip first.
- **Does not upload your sessions anywhere.** It never sends a session or
  `.codexbundle` off your machine — no cloud, no telemetry, no cct server,
  no account. The only outbound actions are the two opt-in **git** features, which
  act on your code and your own git remote, never your sessions: `export
  --git-push` (a plain `git push` of your branch to your remote, never a
  force-push, never repo creation) and `import --clone` (a `git clone`/`fetch` of
  the recorded remote). See §10.
- **Does not require accounts, servers, or a background daemon.**
- **Does not scrub secrets from bundles.** It cannot tell what is sensitive — that
  responsibility stays with you (see §1). Optional `age` encryption (§11)
  controls *who can open* a bundle, but it does not remove secrets from the
  transcript inside.
- **Does not embed a crypto library.** Encryption shells out to the external
  `age` tool; without `age` installed, encryption simply errors.

## 14. Recommended safe workflow

1. On the source machine, run `cct export --project .` from your project
   directory.
2. **Inspect the bundle** before moving it: `cct inspect ./project.codexbundle`.
   Remember the JSONL inside contains the full session transcript.
3. Move the bundle over a channel you trust (USB, `scp`/`rsync` over SSH,
   Syncthing, an encrypted drive). Do **not** post it publicly. If the channel
   is not fully trusted, export with `--encrypt-to <recipient>` (or
   `--passphrase`) and move the resulting `.age` file instead (see §11).
4. On the destination machine, **dry-run first**:
   `cct import ./project.codexbundle --dry-run`. Check the
   **Project folders (recorded cwd)** summary: any folder flagged `[missing]`
   will be hidden from Codex's sidebar until you create it or remap it.
5. If the project path differs, dry-run with an explicit mapping:
   `cct import ./project.codexbundle --map-cwd "OLD=NEW" --dry-run`.
6. If the dry-run looks right, import for real:
   `cct import ./project.codexbundle` or
   `cct import ./project.codexbundle --map-cwd "OLD=NEW"`. If a session
   diverged on this machine and you want the bundle's version, add
   `--replace-with-backup` (a backup of the local file is kept).
7. **Restart the Codex App (or run Codex again)** so it scans and reconciles the
   imported files. For a native Codex bundle you may instead import with
   `--reconcile`; if Codex's experimental protocol is unavailable, follow the
   printed restart guidance. cct prints an exact
   `cct resume <thread-id> --run` fallback only after validating the rollout ID
   as an exact UUID-shaped value and confirming the selected Codex home will be
   preserved byte-for-byte by sh, PowerShell, and cmd.exe. Ambiguous values,
   including homes containing consecutive backslashes, suppress the command and
   leave restart as the safe fallback.
8. If the session needs the project's code on this machine, either export with
   `--with-git` and follow the printed `git clone …` commands, or import with
   `--clone <dir>` to fetch the recorded commit (review the remote URL with
   `inspect` first if the bundle is not from you).
9. **Delete the bundle** once you no longer need it.

## 15. The desktop GUI (`cct app`) is local-only

`cct app` is a convenience face over the same operations, not a new trust
boundary. It runs a small web server **on your machine only** and is built to stay
there:

- **Loopback-only.** It binds to `127.0.0.1`, never a routable address, so it is
  not reachable from the network.
- **Token-gated.** Every `/api` call requires a random token generated fresh each
  launch. The token is delivered only through the URL the app opens in your
  browser; the served HTML/JS contain no token, so another local process cannot
  read it from the page. Requests without the right token are rejected.
- **Host-checked.** Requests whose `Host` header is not a loopback name are
  refused, mitigating DNS-rebinding from a malicious web page.
- **Same safety model.** Export/import go through the exact same core code as the
  CLI: checksums verified before writes, no silent overwrites, SQLite untouched,
  and it **never uploads anything**. The browser is just the UI.
- **Feature parity, with one principled exception.** The GUI now drives the same
  options as the CLI — incremental `--merge`, selective sessions, `--since`,
  cross-agent handoff, git record/push/clone, and recipient/identity-file
  encryption. The exception is **passphrase** encryption/decryption: `age` only
  reads a passphrase from an interactive terminal, which a loopback web request
  cannot supply, so the GUI uses age recipient/identity *key files* and leaves
  passphrase bundles to the terminal (`--passphrase`). The GUI never feeds a
  passphrase to `age` in a way that would hang on the launching console.
- **Outbound actions are still explicit and opt-in.** Just like the CLI, the only
  network actions are `--git-push` (export) and `--clone` (import), and they touch
  *your* git remote only — never your sessions, never any cct service.

It is still a local tool operating on sensitive session files, so run it on a
machine you trust, and stop it (Ctrl-C) when you are done.

## Summary

- Bundles can contain **prompts, code, terminal output, paths, and secrets** —
  do not share them publicly.
- Import **never** overwrites silently; conflicts are reported and skipped unless
  you opt in with `--merge` (append-only sync for a session that grew on another
  device — lossless, no backup needed), `--replace-with-backup` (overwrite,
  keeping a recoverable backup), or `--import-as-copy` (import the bundle's version
  as a new session, leaving yours untouched).
- Checksums are verified **before** any write; a bad bundle changes nothing.
- Path traversal and non-session entries are rejected.
- **SQLite is never touched**; Codex rebuilds its index itself.
- A **cwd mismatch** can hide a correctly-imported session from a project view;
  `inspect`/`import` flag missing project folders so you can spot this.
- `--map-cwd` can fix path mismatch for plain `.jsonl` sessions, but only by
  rewriting the canonical `cwd` field in `session_meta`.
- Bundles can be **encrypted** with the external `age` tool (`--encrypt-to` /
  `--passphrase`); this controls who can open a bundle but does not scrub the
  secrets inside it, and cct still never uploads anything.
